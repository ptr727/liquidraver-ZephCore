 *
 * Zephyr's nrf_qspi_nor driver throws away the reason it failed: qspi_init()
 * does `rc = nrfx_qspi_init() / exit_dpd() / qspi_rdid(); if (rc < 0) return
 * rc;` and only a JEDEC *mismatch* is logged. A flash that never answers looks
 * exactly like one that was never probed, and /ext just fails with -ENODEV.
 *
 * Two things are recovered here. The init return code is not actually lost —
 * a failed init is recorded in the device state as a positive errno, which
 * says which of those three steps broke. And RDID (0x9F) is re-sent by
 * bit-banging the QSPI pins as ordinary single-lane SPI, which needs nothing
 * from the QSPI peripheral and so still answers when the driver has given up:
 *   c8 40 17  - the expected GD25Q64E, so the fault is driver-side
 *   00 00 00  - pins reach the part but it is not driving (unpowered? early?)
 *   ff ff ff  - nothing on the bus at all (wrong pins / no part)
 *
 * Enable with CONFIG_ZEPHCORE_QSPI_RDID_PROBE.
