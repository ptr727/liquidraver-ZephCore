 * Probe the declared RTC chips in order, stopping at the first that holds a
 * sane time (year >= 2025 and its power-loss flag clear): store its Unix
 * epoch in *epoch_out and return true. The first chip found (valid time or
 * not) is remembered as the write-back target. A failed first read means
 * nothing is there, and a first read of all 0xFF (an erased EEPROM) is
 * skipped. Otherwise a device is passed over only if two reads each show it
 * is not that RTC: a bit set that the data sheet shows as 0 (the
 * descriptor's zero-mask), seconds, minutes, date or month out of range
 * while the power-loss flag does not read as set (an unreadable flag counts
 * as not set), or, on the second read, all 0xFF. A failed second read never
 * rules a device out. A time is taken only from a clean read whose fields,
 * hours and year are each in range, and never while the descriptor's
 * twelve-hour-bit reads set or cannot be read; a set bit outside the time
 * block is then cleared on the adopted chip. Returns false if none present or no trustworthy
 * time is held.
 *
 * At a descriptor with rv3028-eeprom-config, the time is read once more
 * with the chip's backup switch flag (BSF) cleared before and checked
 * after, and is not taken if the read failed or BSF was set. A chip adopted
 * on a read that identified it (not on a failed second read), with BSF
 * clear, has that config stored at once: after the power-on refresh (up to
 * ~66 ms), backup switchover is turned off while the EEPROM is read, each
 * byte that differs is written, and a refresh from EEPROM restores it.
 * Measured on a RAK4631: about 14 ms when nothing is written, 52 ms for two
 * bytes, then up to 2 ms for DSM to react (4.2.2). If the store fails, the
 * config is set in RAM, which lasts until the chip's next refresh from
 * EEPROM (daily while EERD is clear), and only once EEbusy reads 0;
 * otherwise switchover stays as the store left it, off once the store has
 * disabled it, until a retry or that refresh. A failed store, or one
 * skipped at boot, is retried on the system work queue every 10 minutes, at
 * most 3 times, each retry identifying the chip again first.

 * If restore adopted nothing but skipped a candidate whose first read was all

 * At a descriptor with rv3028-eeprom-config the time is written with BSF

 * so a write cut by a power loss reads at boot as "time not yet set". A
 * write not confirmed is repeated every 5 s on the system work queue, with
 * the time run on, until one is confirmed, a newer save replaces it, or 12
 * repeats (13 attempts in all) have failed. Call only from the system work
 * queue: the repeat shares state with this call.
